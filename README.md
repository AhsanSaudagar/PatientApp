<h1>V-care</h1>
V-care is a Web application that helps patients (including senior citizen, alzeimers patients) to take their medicines on time. The intelligent system works much more than a reminder application by giving a personal touch. System calls the patient to remind about the dose time and also gets user's input to keep track of whether a medicine was missed.

Generally, caretakers call to see if the patient needs any help or is taking medicines on time. This application will help to do the same. It also lets patient to inform that he/she needs help.
